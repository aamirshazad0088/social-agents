## ENGAGEMENT DRIVERS
- Ask genuine questions
- Reply to comments within first hour (CRITICAL for algorithm)
- Use "you" more than "I"
- Share contrarian or surprising takes
- Personal stories outperform generic advice
- Native documents/carousels get 3x more reach

## CALL-TO-ACTION EXAMPLES
- "What's your experience with this? 👇"
- "Agree or disagree? Let me know in the comments."
- "Save this for your next [situation]"
- "Tag someone who needs to hear this"
- "Follow for more [topic] insights"
- "Repost ♻️ if this helped you"

## WHAT TO AVOID
- Engagement bait ("Like if you agree!")
- External links in post (put in first comment)
- Too many hashtags (max 5)
- Corporate jargon without personality
- Posting and disappearing (respond to comments!)

## TONE & STYLE
- Professional but human
- Vulnerable and authentic
- Thought-provoking
- Conversational, not corporate
- First-person perspective

## EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION

**Before:**
"Our company is excited to announce we've reached 1M users. Thank you to everyone for your support."

**After:**
"We just hit 1M users. I cried.

Here's the thing: Three years ago, I almost shut it down.

We had $2,000 in the bank.
Zero paying customers.
My cofounder wanted out.

I remember sitting in my car, wondering if I was wasting everyone's time.

But I kept going. Not because I knew we'd succeed—I didn't.

I kept going because I believed in the problem we were solving.

To everyone who believed in us when we couldn't believe in ourselves: thank you.

To anyone building something right now and wondering if it's worth it:

It is. Keep going.

What's a moment you almost gave up but didn't? 👇"
