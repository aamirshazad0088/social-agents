## PLATFORM OVERVIEW
- **Organic Post Length**: Optimal 40-80 characters for engagement
- **Link Posts**: Description up to 500 characters
- **Hashtags**: 1-2 max (less is more)
- **Priority**: Community, Groups, Reels, Live

## POST TYPES & STRATEGIES

### Text-Only Posts
Best for engagement - algorithms favor original content without links
```
[Short, punchy question or statement]

[Personal story or insight]

[Engagement prompt - question]
```

### Photo Posts
- Native uploads > Links
- Carousel photos perform well
- Behind-the-scenes content
- User-generated content

### Video Posts
- Native upload (not YouTube links)
- Vertical for Reels
- Captions essential (85% watch muted)
- First 3 seconds = hook

### Link Posts
- Compelling preview image
- Put link in comments for better reach
- Or use brief intro, link in first comment

## HOOK FORMULAS

### Question Hooks
- "What's your biggest challenge with [topic]?"
- "If you could change one thing about [area], what would it be?"
- "Who remembers when [nostalgic thing]?"

### Story Hooks
- "I never thought I'd say this, but..."
- "Something happened yesterday that really made me think..."
- "I made a huge mistake with [area]. Here's what I learned..."

### Opinion Hooks
- "Unpopular opinion:"
- "I might be wrong, but..."
- "Am I the only one who thinks..."

### Nostalgia Hooks
- "Remember when [past thing]?"
- "Back in [year], we used to [common experience]..."
- "Kids today will never understand [thing]..."

## POST STRUCTURE

What do you think? 👇
```

[Question - drive comments]
```

### Group Post

```

## FACEBOOK GROUPS STRATEGY
- Ask questions to boost engagement
- Create weekly themed posts (like "Win Wednesday")
- Welcome new members personally
- Pin valuable content
- Use polls regularly
- Go live in groups

## FACEBOOK REELS
- Vertical format (9:16)
- 15-90 seconds optimal
- Trending audio helps reach
- Text overlays for silent viewing
- Hook in first 3 seconds
- Native content, not reposts

## ENGAGEMENT DRIVERS
- Ask simple, easy-to-answer questions
- Use "this or that" formats
- Create fill-in-the-blank posts
- Share relatable moments
- Celebrate community wins
- Respond to every comment

### Fill-in-the-Blank Examples
- "The best advice I ever got was ______"
- "I can't start my day without ______"
- "This year, I'm finally going to ______"

### This or That Examples
- "Coffee ☕ or Tea 🍵?"
- "Morning person 🌅 or Night owl 🦉?"

## CALL-TO-ACTION EXAMPLES
- "Drop a 💙 if you agree"
- "Tag someone who needs to see this"
- "Share your experience in the comments 👇"
- "Save this for later"
- "Share to your story if this resonates"

## WHAT WORKS IN 2025
- Authentic, personal content
- Community-building over broadcasting
- Video content (especially Reels)
- Engagement-driving questions
- Native content vs external links
- Groups over Pages for reach

## WHAT TO AVOID
- External links in main content (hurts reach)
- Too many hashtags
- Engagement bait ("Like this post!")
- Over-promotional content
- Ignoring comments

## EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION

**Before:**
"Check out our new blog post about productivity tips! Link: [url]"

**After:**
"I used to work 12-hour days and get NOTHING done.

Then I tried something different:
• Block 2 hours for deep work (phone off)
• Batch similar tasks together
• Stop checking email every 5 minutes

Game-changer.

What's ONE productivity habit that changed YOUR life? 👇
