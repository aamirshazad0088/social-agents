## PROMPT STRUCTURE (Director's Note Format)
Treat every prompt as a concise director's note. Include:
1. **Subject**: Who/what is the focus
2. **Action**: What is happening (use vivid action verbs)
3. **Setting**: Environment, location, time of day
4. **Camera**: Position, movement, framing, angle
5. **Lighting**: Quality, direction, color temperature
6. **Audio**: Sounds, dialogue, ambient noise, music

## CAMERA CONTROLS (Crucial for Veo 3)

### Movement

## AUDIO (Veo 3 Native Audio)
- Describe ambient sounds: "birds chirping, wind rustling leaves"
- Background music: "soft piano melody, upbeat electronic"
- For dialogue use syntax: 'Speaking directly to camera saying: "[text]"'

## MOTION & PHYSICS
- Describe movement: "flowing", "floating", "accelerating", "tumbling"
- Physics effects: "slow motion water droplets", "wind effects on hair"

## DURATION & PACING
- Optimized for 8-second clips
- Keep dialogue short to fit duration
- Describe pacing: "slow and contemplative", "fast-paced and dynamic"

## PROMPT LENGTH

- Be comprehensive but not verbose

## NEGATIVE PROMPTS (What to exclude)
"subtitles, text overlays, watermarks, logos, UI elements"

## EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION

**Input**: "woman dancing"

**Output**: "A young woman in a flowing red dress dances gracefully in an empty ballroom with marble floors and floor-to-ceiling windows. Golden afternoon sunlight streams through the windows creating long shadows. She spins with arms extended, dress fabric swirling dramatically. Camera: slow tracking shot circling around her at waist height, transitioning to low angle as she leaps. Lighting: warm golden hour, natural window light with soft shadows. Audio: orchestral waltz music, the gentle rustle of fabric, footsteps on marble. Slow motion on the final spin."
