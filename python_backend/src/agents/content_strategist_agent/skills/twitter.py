## PLATFORM OVERVIEW
- **Character Limit**: 280 characters (4,000 for Premium)
- **Thread Limit**: Up to 25 tweets in a thread
- **Hashtags**: 1-2 max (or none for higher engagement)
- **Media**: Images get 150%+ more engagement

## TWEET FORMULAS THAT WORK

### The Bold Statement
"[Controversial but true opinion]."
- Clear, punchy, takes a stand
- Invites agreement/disagreement

### The How-To
"How to [achieve desired outcome]:

1. [Step]
2. [Step]  
3. [Step]

Thread 🧵"

### The Question
"Why does [common thing] actually [surprising aspect]?"
- Curiosity-driven
- Invites discussion

### The List Tease
"[X] things [audience] doesn't realize:

1. [Surprising thing]
2. [Surprising thing]
..."

### The Story Hook
"I [did unusual thing]. Here's what happened:"

### The Hot Take
"Unpopular opinion: [bold claim]"

## TWEET STRUCTURE (280 chars)
```
[Hook - demand attention]
[Value or insight - deliver immediately]
[CTA or continuation tease]
```

## THREAD STRUCTURE
```
Tweet 1: [Hook] + "Thread 🧵" or "Here's what I learned:"
Tweet 2-N: [Each tweet = one complete idea]
Final Tweet: [Summary + CTA + "RT the first tweet to share"]
```

### Thread Best Practices
- First tweet must stand alone as valuable
- Each tweet = one complete thought
- Use numbered lists when applicable
- Include images/media every 3-4 tweets
- End with clear CTA + prompt to retweet first

## ENGAGEMENT TACTICS

### Reply Strategy
- Reply thoughtfully to big accounts in your niche
- Quote-tweet with added insight (not just "Great point!")
- First 30 minutes are crucial for replies

### Engagement Drivers
- Ask questions that people want to answer
- Create debate with contrarian takes
- Use "which would you choose" formats
- Polls get algorithmic boost

### Timing
- Best times: 8-9 AM, 12-1 PM, 5-6 PM (audience timezone)
- Consistency > Perfect timing

## CALL-TO-ACTION EXAMPLES
- "Retweet if this helped you"
- "What would you add?"
- "Follow me for more [topic]"
- "Bookmark this for later"
- "Drop a 🔥 if you agree"

## FORMATTING TIPS
- Line breaks between ideas
- Use emojis sparingly as bullets
- Numbers at start of lists
- Thread indicator: 🧵 or "Thread"
- No hashtags in thread content (maybe 1 at end)

## WHAT WORKS IN 2025
- Authentic > Polished
- Original takes > Rephrased quotes
- Personal stories > Generic advice
- Visual threads > Text-only
- Replies and engagement > Just posting

## WHAT TO AVOID
- Too many hashtags (looks spammy)
- Engagement bait without value
- Being mean-spirited
- Overwhelming with links
- Stealing tweets/not crediting

## EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION

**Before:**
"Here are some tips for better productivity. You should wake up early and plan your day. Also try to avoid distractions."

**After:**
"I 10x'd my productivity with 3 simple rules:

1. First 2 hours = Deep work (no phone)
2. Batch similar tasks together
3. Plan tomorrow before bed

Took me 10 years to figure this out.

Sharing in 60 seconds: 🧵"
