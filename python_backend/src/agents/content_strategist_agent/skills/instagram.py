    "description": "Expert for Instagram content: captions, hashtags, hooks, Reels, Stories, Carousels. Includes 2025 best practices and engagement formulas.",
    "content": """# Instagram Content Expert - 2025

## PLATFORM OVERVIEW
- **Character Limit**: 2,200 (but first 125 visible before "more")
- **Hashtags**: Up to 30 (optimal: 9 for 28% more engagement)
- **Content Priority**: Reels > Carousels > Images > Text

## HOOK FORMULAS (First 125 Characters)
The first line determines if they tap "more". Use these patterns:

### Curiosity Hooks
- "Did you know...?"
- "The secret no one tells you about..."
- "You won't believe what happened..."
- "Here's what 99% of people get wrong about..."

### FOMO/Urgency Hooks
- "Stop scrolling if you..."
- "You need this before..."
- "Don't start your day without..."
- "This changed everything for me..."

### Question Hooks
- "What would you do if...?"
- "Who else feels this way?"
- "Can we talk about...?"
- "Ready to learn...?"

### Benefit Hooks
- "Here's how to finally..."
- "The easiest way to..."
- "Save this for when you need..."

## CAPTION STRUCTURE
```
[Engaging Hook - First 125 chars CRITICAL]

[Story/Value - Break into short paragraphs]

[Call-to-Action]
.
.
.
[Hashtags - place below line breaks]
```

## HASHTAG STRATEGY
- **Mix**: 3 broad + 3 niche + 3 branded
- **Optimal Count**: 9 hashtags = 28% more engagement
- **Placement**: Below content with line breaks
- **Length**: 21-24 character hashtags perform 20% better
- **Avoid**: Banned hashtags, #follow4follow type

## POST TYPE OPTIMIZATION

### Feed Posts
- Medium captions (150-300 words) for storytelling
- Use line breaks for readability
- End with save-worthy CTA

### Reels
- Short hooks (first 3 seconds critical)
- Caption complements video, doesn't repeat
- Trending audio boosts reach
- Use text overlays in video

### Carousels
- First slide = hook image
- 7-10 slides optimal
- Educational content performs best
- Last slide = strong CTA

### Stories
- Interactive stickers (polls, questions)
- Behind-the-scenes content
- Swipe-up/Link stickers for CTAs

## CALL-TO-ACTION EXAMPLES
- "Save this for later 📌"
- "Tag someone who needs this"
- "Drop a 🔥 if you agree"
- "Double tap if this resonates"
- "Share to your story if you found this helpful"
- "Comment [word] and I'll send you..."

## EMOJI STRATEGY
- Use strategically, not excessively
- 1-3 emojis per paragraph
- Use as bullet point replacements
- Match brand personality

## TONE & STYLE
- Visual, engaging, lifestyle-focused
- Authentic > Perfect
- Conversational and relatable
- "Less perfect, more real" trending
