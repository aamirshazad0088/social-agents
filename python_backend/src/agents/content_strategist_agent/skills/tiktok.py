**Value Hooks**

- "The hack [target audience] doesn't want you to know"

**Relatable Hooks**
- "Me when [relatable scenario]..."
- "When you [common experience]..."
- "That feeling when [universal moment]..."

**Movement/Pattern Interrupt**
- Start with unusual movement
- Mid-action opening
- Close-up that pulls back

## EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION

**Before:**
Script: "Hello everyone, today I'm going to share some productivity tips with you. So the first tip is..."

**After:**
Script: 
"[Close-up walking in] I made $100K this year by doing ONE thing every morning.

[Cut to list on screen] Not what you think:
- Not meditation
- Not journaling  
- Not working out

[Back to face] It's this: I do my hardest task FIRST. Before email. Before calls. Before anything.

Most people save the hard stuff for later. By then? Your brain is fried.

[Point at camera] Try it tomorrow. Come back and tell me I'm right.
