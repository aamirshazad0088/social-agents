## EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION

**Before:**
"We just launched a new product that helps companies improve their workflow. Check it out!"

**After:**
"I spent 3 years watching teams waste 10+ hours weekly on manual processes.

Here's what I observed:

→ Talented people doing repetitive work
→ Burnout becoming the norm
→ Innovation taking a backseat

So we built something different.

Not another tool that adds complexity.
But one that removes friction entirely.

The result?

Our beta users got back 12 hours per week.
Not by working harder.
By eliminating work that shouldn't exist.

What's one process in your company that desperately needs to die?
