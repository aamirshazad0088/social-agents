## PLATFORM OVERVIEW
- **Character Limit**: 280 per tweet (threads for longer)
- **Hashtags**: 1-2 per tweet (less is more)
- **Algorithm Priority**: Engagement in first 5-10 minutes critical
- **Content Priority**: Video > Threads > Images > Text

## 2025 ALGORITHM INSIGHTS
The algorithm rewards:
- Replies, retweets, likes, bookmarks
- Engagement velocity (first 5-10 minutes crucial)
- Time spent on post
- Native media (especially video)
- Thread engagement throughout

## TWEET FORMULAS

### Hot Take Tweets
- "Unpopular opinion: [controversial take]"
- "[Thing everyone loves] is overrated. Here's why:"
- "Most people think X. The truth is Y."

### Listicle Tweets
- "5 things I wish I knew about [topic]:"
- "The top 3 mistakes [personas] make:"
- "10 tools that changed my [workflow]:"

### Story Tweets
- "Here's how I went from [A] to [B]:"
- "Last year, I was [struggling]. Now:"
- "A thread on what [experience] taught me:"

### Question Tweets
- "What's one [thing] that changed your life?"
- "Hot take: [statement]. Agree or disagree?"
- "What would you do if...?"

## THREAD BEST PRACTICES
Threads get 63% more impressions than single tweets.

### Thread Structure
```
Tweet 1: IRRESISTIBLE HOOK (most important)
Tweet 2-N: One idea per tweet, logical flow
Final: Clear CTA + hashtags
```

### Thread Rules
- **Hook is Everything**: First tweet determines success
- **One Idea Per Tweet**: Clear, complete thoughts
- **Optimal Length**: 5-10 tweets (max engagement)
- **Visual Breaks**: Add image every 3-4 tweets
- **Open Loops**: Tease next tweet to keep reading
- **Numbering**: Use "1/" format for clarity

### Thread Hook Examples
- "I spent [time] studying [topic]. Here's what I learned:"
- "Most [personas] fail at [thing]. Here's the fix:"
- "[Number] lessons that took me [years] to learn:"
- "The secret behind [impressive thing]:"

## FORMATTING RULES
- **Line Breaks**: Use for readability
- **Emojis**: Strategic use (1-2 per tweet = 25% more engagement)
- **White Space**: Makes content scannable
- **No Hashtags Mid-Tweet**: Put at end or skip entirely

## HASHTAG STRATEGY
- Use 1-2 relevant hashtags maximum
- Place in final tweet of thread
- Too many hashtags = spam signal
- Research trending hashtags daily

## ENGAGEMENT TACTICS
- Engage more than you post (especially smaller accounts)
- Reply to comments within first hour
- Quote tweet with added value
- Comment on relevant posts in your niche
- Ask genuine questions

## CALL-TO-ACTION EXAMPLES
- "Retweet if you found this useful"
- "Follow for more [topic]"
- "Bookmark this for later"
- "Reply with your thoughts"
- "Quote tweet with your experience"
- "Like if you want more of this"

## TONE & STYLE
- Concise, witty, sharp
- Hot takes work well
- Personality > Corporate
- First-person perspective
- Conversational and authentic

## VIDEO ON X
Video is the biggest engagement driver in 2025:
- Native video vastly outperforms links
- Keep videos under 2 minutes
- Add captions (most watch muted)
- Hook in first second

## TIMING
- Peak: Weekdays 12-1 PM EST, 5-6 PM EST
- Weekend: 10-11 AM EST
- Check your analytics for your audience

## EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION

**Before:**
"We're excited to announce our new product launch. Check out our website for more information."

**After:**
"We've been building something in secret for 8 months.

Today, it's live.

Here's the story of how it came together 🧵

1/ It started with a single complaint from a customer.

'Why is this so complicated?'

They were right.

2/ So we scrapped everything.

Started from zero.

Asked one question: What if this took 10 seconds instead of 10 minutes?

3/ 8 months. 47 prototypes. Countless failures.

But today?

10 seconds. Exactly.

4/ We're not charging more for less.

Same price. 60x faster.
