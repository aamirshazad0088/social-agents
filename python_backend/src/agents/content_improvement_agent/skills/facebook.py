## PLATFORM OVERVIEW
- **Character Limit**: 63,206 (optimal: 40-80 words)
- **Hashtags**: 2-3 relevant (minimal use)
- **Algorithm**: AI-driven, interest-based (not just friends)
- **Content Priority**: Reels > Video > Interactive Posts > Images > Text

## 2025 ALGORITHM INSIGHTS
Facebook now prioritizes:
- Content from "unconnected" accounts (not just friends)
- Meaningful interactions (comments > likes)
- Content people share in private messages
- Native content (uploaded directly, not linked)
- Real images over AI-generated

## HOOK FORMULAS
Capture attention in first line to stop the scroll.

### Emotional Hooks
- "This made my day..."
- "I can't stop thinking about..."
- "You won't believe what just happened..."

### Question Hooks
- "Am I the only one who...?"
- "What would you do if...?"
- "Can we talk about...?"

### Community Hooks
- "Fellow [group] parents/fans/members..."
- "This is for everyone who..."
- "Tag someone who..."

### Story Hooks
- "Last week, something unexpected happened..."
- "I've been hesitant to share this..."

## POST STRUCTURE
```
[Engaging Hook - First line critical]

[Story/Value - Short paragraphs]

[Question or CTA to spark discussion]

[Optional: Link in first comment]
```

## CONTENT FORMATS

### Reels (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- Up to 90 seconds (sweet spot: 30-60)
- First 3 seconds = critical hook
- Educational, inspirational, or entertaining
- Repurpose from Instagram/TikTok BUT:
  - Upload native (no watermarks)
  - Optimize for Facebook audience

### Video Posts
- Native video vastly outperforms links
- Include captions (85% watch without sound)
- Square or vertical format
- Hook in first 3 seconds

### Image Posts
- Real photos > stock images
- Carousel format for engagement
- Behind-the-scenes content performs well

### Interactive Posts
- Polls and quizzes
- "This or That" questions
- Fill-in-the-blank posts
- Reaction posts ("React with ❤️ if...")

## FACEBOOK GROUPS STRATEGY
Groups are increasingly important for reach and community.

### Group Posting Best Practices
- Welcome new members personally
- Host live Q&A sessions
- Run polls and contests
- Share valuable resources
- Encourage member-to-member interaction
- Moderate for quality

### Group CTAs
- "What's your experience with...?"
- "Share your best tip below"
- "I'd love your feedback on..."

## HASHTAG STRATEGY
- Use sparingly: 2-3 relevant hashtags
- Place at end of post
- Less important than other platforms
- Focus on search-friendly terms

## ENGAGEMENT TACTICS
- Respond to comments quickly (signals value to algorithm)
- Ask open-ended questions
- Use interactive stickers in Stories
- Create shareable content (DM-worthy)
- Post when audience is most active

## CALL-TO-ACTION EXAMPLES
- "What do you think? Drop a comment below 👇"
- "Share this with someone who needs it"
- "Tag a friend who would love this"
- "React with ❤️ if you agree"
- "What's your take on this?"

## TONE & STYLE
- Conversational, community-focused
- Personal and authentic
- Less polished than Instagram
- Storytelling works well
- Emotional content performs best

## TIPS FOR REACH
- Put links in first comment (not post)
- Native content > external links
- Avoid engagement bait ("Like if...")
- Post at peak times (mid-morning, midday)
- Consistency over frequency

## EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION

**Before:**
"Just launched our new website! Check it out here: [link]"

**After:**
"I've been working on something for 6 months.

Late nights. Early mornings. Countless revisions.

And today, it's finally live.

This isn't just a website redesign.

It's the result of listening to every single piece of feedback you've shared with us over the years.

Here's what's new:
✅ Faster checkout (30 seconds or less)
✅ Mobile-first design
✅ Real customer stories front and center

I'd love to know what you think.
