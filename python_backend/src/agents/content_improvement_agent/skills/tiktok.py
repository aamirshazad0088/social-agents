    "content": """# TikTok Content Expert - 2025

## PLATFORM OVERVIEW
- **Caption Limit**: 2,200 characters (optimal: under 150)
- **Hashtags**: 3-5 relevant + trending
- **Algorithm Priority**: Watch time > Completion rate > Engagement
- **Critical Window**: First 1-3 seconds determine if they stay

## HOOK FORMULAS (First 1-3 Seconds)
The hook is EVERYTHING on TikTok. Pattern interrupts stop the scroll.

### Curiosity Gap Hooks
- "I cannot believe I didn't discover this earlier…"
- "What happens next will shock you…"
- "No one is talking about this…"
- "POV: You just learned..."

### Problem/Solution Hooks
- "Stop scrolling if you struggle with..."
- "Struggling with [problem]? Here's the fix."
- "This is for anyone who..."
- "The [thing] no one tells you about..."

### Direct Call-Out Hooks
- "If you're a [persona], watch this."
- "Only watch this if you want to..."
- "You NEED to try this."

### FOMO Hooks
- "This [trend] is everywhere right now."
- "Everyone's doing this wrong."
- "I wish I knew this sooner."

## CAPTION STRUCTURE
```
[Short, punchy hook that matches video]
[Optional context or tease]
[Hashtags]
```

## CAPTION RULES
- **Keep it SHORT**: Under 150 characters ideal
- **Match the Video**: Caption complements, doesn't repeat
- **Personality First**: Casual, authentic, relatable
- **Emojis Welcome**: Use liberally for Gen-Z appeal
- **Trending References**: Pop culture, memes, current events

## HASHTAG STRATEGY
- Use 3-5 targeted hashtags
- Mix: Trending + Niche + Descriptive
- #fyp and #foryou still help discovery
- Use hashtags as SEO keywords
- Say keywords OUT LOUD in video too

## POST TYPE OPTIMIZATION

### Standard TikToks
- Hook in first 1-3 seconds
- Keep viewers watching to end
- Loopable content = more views

### Tutorials
- "Here's how to..." format
- Step-by-step with text overlays
- Save-worthy content

### Trends
- Put your own twist on trending sounds
- Act fast (trends die quickly)
- Original interpretation > carbon copy

### Storytimes
- Narrative hooks work great
- Build suspense throughout
- Satisfying conclusion

## CALL-TO-ACTION EXAMPLES
- "Drop a 🔥 if you agree!"
- "Tag a friend who needs this!"
- "Comment [word] if you want part 2"
- "Save this for later!"
- "Follow for more [topic]"
- "Stitch this with your reaction"

## TONE & STYLE
- Trendy, authentic, entertaining
- Gen-Z casual language
- Self-deprecating humor works
- "Unpolished" often outperforms polished
- Fast-paced, dynamic energy

## TRENDING ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE
- Trending audio/sounds
- Current memes and references
- Dance challenges (if relevant)
- Duet/Stitch potential
- Behind-the-scenes content

## ALGORITHM TIPS
- Videos 15-35 seconds with 80-90% completion = gold
- Videos over 60 seconds also favored
- Post when audience is active
- Consistency matters (1-3x daily ideal)
- Engage with comments immediately
